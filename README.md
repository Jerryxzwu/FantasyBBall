This fantasy basketball application is written to streamline my decision making process in the 2020-21 AKPsi Fantasy Basketball League on Yahoo. The application will, upon authentication by an user, collect and analyze the recent stats of NBA players active in the user's league. The application will project the stats of these NBA players in future matches. The projection will initially be a simple extrapolation, but as time permits ideally develop into a more nuanced model that takes injuries/rest of teammates, competitive conditions (home/road games), and such into consideration. The application will project the total stats of future weeks for the user's team, and recommend optimal streaming options/pickups depending on the projected stats of the opponent's team.
